Node Serve - Node Core Modules

# About

This is a node server created with the node core modules.
In the current version, only html and css files are sent in the response. In the future I will update the project to handle other types of files and more complex file paths.
It's only a project for reference and study purposes, don't use it in real projects.

# How to use it

1. Install node in your computer
2. Open the terminal in the project path and run the command:

```shell
node server.js
```

3. Open in the navigator the following link:
   http://localhost:3000
